# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## MVP

- Set up basic files with HTML/JS/CSS, for this I'll be using ES6 modules to structure the JS files
- Architecture: modules or factories, our first variables are gameBoard and displayController, using factories for multiple players
- Use functions that allow people to create marks on the gameBoard
- Build logic that checks when the game is over
- Consider option of having players compete against the computer
- Explore possibility of creating an hard-to-beat/unbeatable AI (minmax algorithm)
- Interface that allows players to display whether or not they've won
